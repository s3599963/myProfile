	<p> <strong>Overview</strong> <br><br>

			‘Remy’ is an internet browser extension plugin that keeps a log of your pantry and assists with discovering food recipes and suggesting ingredients based on what you have at your disposal  in your kitchen. </p> <br>


			<strong>Motivation</strong>
			<p>
			Victorians are throwing out 250,000 tonnes of food annually with a large portion of that figure being edible food! The average Victorian household bins $2136 in food waste a year, that’s $42 a week or $21360 spanned over a decade!
			Additionally, whatever mental energy that hasn’t been wrung out of my brain after an enduring day usually stands no chance in deciding what to cook.
			On top of that, I couldn’t even tell you what I have in the fridge, and if I do remember something, chances are it’s almost off. This plugin is a proposed solution to rescue money and time.</p> <br>

			<strong>Description</strong>
			<p>
			Remy is the finest, most well-mannered, web crawling, digital arachnid assistant chef you’ll ever meet.<br><br>

			The user will download and install the browser extension.
			Once installed the user will click on the icon and be prompted to create a “ + new pantry”.
			Once a new pantry is established, a small window will proceed to display categories of food types.<br><br>
 
			E.g. <br><br>

 			<center>Meats, Dairy, Fruit, Vegetable, Herb, Spice.</center><br><br>


			Ordered alphabetically under each category will be the foods that belong to the corresponding group. <br><br>
			
			E.g.<br><br>
			<center>
 			<i>Fruit</i><br><br>
 			Apricot _<br>
			Apple _<br>
 			Banana _<br>
 			Cantaloupe _</center><br><br> 

			Users will tick off what food they currently have.<br><br>

 			<center><i>Fruit</i><br><br>
 			Apricot _<br>
			Apple ☑<br>
 			Banana ☑<br>
 			Cantaloupe _</center><br><br>

			Inputs will be automatically saved as they click through.Once filling out is complete, the window can be minimized and Remy will remain active behind the scenes scouring cooking websites, scanning for recipes with high matches of corresponding ingredients.<br><br>

			If a user on their own accord were to visit a webpage that featured a recipe, Remy would automatically scan for ingredient matches and return the results.
			Unmatched ingredients would be highlighted with the added option to add them into a separate “grocery list” log. Ingredients can also be added manually into the list.<br><br>

			The grocery list can then in turn be used on your online supermarket of choice, where it will autonomously fill your online shopping cart for you, removing the need to manually input items yourself. A brief review of the shopping cart and you’ve sent your order which can be later be collected or delivered to your residence.<br><br>

			Recipes that you’ve made or saved can be bookmarked and rated with the option to annotate (what worked, what didn’t).
			Over time you’ll be recommended recipes tailored to your taste based on what meals you have previously cooked and relished.<br><br><br>


			<strong>Tools and Technologies</strong><br>

			<p>
			We’ll use chrome as the example.
			Chrome extensions are written utilizing three languages;
			HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
			A spider/ web crawler will be used to collect matching keywords from ingredient sections of a recipes webpage, these spiders are usually written in Python. Facilitating Python in JavaScript is made possible using a Python to JavaScript compiler known as (Rapydscript).

			A web API will be built to fulfil the function of autonomously filling the shopping cart with items that are in the “grocery list”.
			Rapydscript is called upon once more for machine learning, algorithms used to suggest recipes.
			HTML and CSS will be written to make the UI friendly and intuitive.</p><br>


			<strong>Skills Required</strong>
			<p>
			To reiterate Tools and Technologies, the prerequisite knowledge to materialize this concept, is being able to construct and assemble these functions using the languages on offer.
			Knowing how to program a WebCrawler that targets specific websites with Python. Compiling that Python code to JavaScript with Rapydscript.
			How does a spider automatically identify the ingredients section of a webpage?
			HTML / CSS expertise for an intuitive front end experience.</p><br>


			<strong>Outcome</strong>
			<p>
			If this project were to become successful, the end user will enjoy a banquet of benefits at the hands of an intuitive application coupled with autonomy and machine learning. The key subject but not limited to…

			-Reduced decision fatigue on deciding what to cook for dinner.
			-Money saved from preventing food going off or being thrown out.
			-Conserved time for the end user through automated processes.
			-Compounding culinary knowledge through diverse yet well-tailored recipe recommendation.
