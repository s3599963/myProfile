				Although the validity of the Myres Briggs test is heavily debated, I’ve undergone the test on 3 seperate occasions over the past 2 years with no variation in output.
				One too cannot refute the presence of personal biases when completing the test, botched results are probable in that regard.

				Personally I have found the test assists me by lending a scope to observe my personality from a 3rd person perspective, opening a window of opportunity to personal improvements that otherwise would have been overlooked by obliviousness or stubbornness. I’m in accordance with everything it describes, preferring working alone and or in small groups with likeminded personalities who don’t waste time with menial tasks or argue with the truth. Knowing the personalities that comprise  other groups and their level of compatibility that runs parallel to the INJT-A will partially determine what I repel away from or gravitate towards, ultimately I’d look for disciplined easy going individuals.</p>

				<p> The supplementary results derived from the learning styles quiz display an even score across 3 of the 4 categories with ‘pragmatic’, ‘reflector’ and ‘theorist’ each yielding %30 arguing that I value discussion, theory and practice proportionally. The remaining %10 allocated to ‘Activist’, detailing lesser favourability to time consuming group discussions and role-play.</p>
				<p> Finally the big 5 personality metrics are to be considered with an iota of sodium chloride if not at all, the questionnaire possessed shallow depth (haha yes I know, typical for someone with low agreeableness to disagree!).</p>
