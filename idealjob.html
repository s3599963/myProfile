                <p> Acknowledged as one of the technology pioneers for 2020 by the World Economic Forum, Wingcopter is a newly hatched aviation company aiming solve the logistical challenges faced when delivering medicine to rural 3rd world villages. The position would conveniently relocate me to Germany, where I will be a part of a diverse tight knit team all sharing identical fervour.
				The job itself will consist of writing and modifying flight control software, developing solutions for autonomous flying with the help of open sourced PX4 autopilot systems. 
				Frequent comprehensive liaising between the UI and drone development team will be expected to ensure deliverance of a supreme product. </p>


				<p> Proving candid for the role will require fluency and experience with C++ and python, as the two are commonly used for programming autonomous vehicles. Having a backed history of working on related projects that involve PX4 autopilot.
				Changes made to the software will need to be made immediately available for the rest of the team; therefore competency using GitHub is a must. Applicants equipped with knowledge of aeronautical engineering, flight mechanics and or have practiced model/ manned flying will be deemed as favourable assets for the company, as they’ll have an edge when adequately communicating with the hardware development team.</p>

				With no relevant technical skills, I am at ground floor ready to construct a tower of expertise.

				1. Complete the 2 RMIT units with a weighted score ≥ 80%<br><br>

				2. Use these results for access into undertaking a 4 year course studying software engineering, developing abilities and acquiring the credential<br>  <br>

				3. Alongside studying, take up related projects in spare time that involve tinkering with Model flying, robotics, APM flight stack, C++ and Python<br><br>

				4. Enrol and complete an aeronautical engineering short course<br><br>

				5. Get an employment visa so I’m eligible to work in Germany<br><br>
