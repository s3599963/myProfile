	<p> The fruits of IT have always been around me, glinting curiosities ever present from my childhood days of tampering with the hardware of gaming consoles to perform an array of glitches inside of the games I was playing.</p>

				<p>In hindsight, a germinal moment was the genesis of the iPhone. Seeing my uncle with an iPhone and its innovative features was akin to witnessing magic. As time marched forward the notion of magic transitionally phased-out, replaced by a grasp and an appreciation for the genius that follows pooling together teams with exemplary skillsets to collaborate to produce ‘magic’.  I’d wish to be part of a team that contributes to a new technology that produces a similar feeling to what I had felt in 2007. </p>

				<p>Aside from being reputable, I chose to study with RMIT because they were offering what I was searching for, two units to act as a stepping stone into a software engineering degree. During the coming months I expect to have gained basic bread and butter knowledge in foundational concepts comprising IT. More importantly I anticipate a personal growth in confidence when working with teams and utilizing essential global collaborative services like GitHub.</p>
